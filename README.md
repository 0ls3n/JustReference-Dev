# JustReference Audio Plugin

A minimalist JUCE-based plugin that helps you make better mixing decisions — **with your ears, not your eyes**.

## Why Use This?

Modern plugins are often cluttered with flashy meters, analyzers, and visual gimmicks that can distract from what matters most: **how it sounds**. This plugin is designed for producers and engineers who trust their ears. It provides a fast and simple A/B switch between your mix and a reference track, without getting in your way.

> *Built to sharpen your ears — not your eyes.*
